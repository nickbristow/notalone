<p>Colleges and universities that participate in the federal student financial aid programs are subject to Title IX and the Clery Act, and must comply their requirements that certain employees report incidents of sexual violence to school officials and notify students about the outcome when they file complaints of sexual violence. </p>

<p>We created a chart to help schools understand these requirements, clarify how they intersect with students’ rights under FERPA, and resolve any concerns about apparent conflicts. </p>

<h2 id="maintaining-confidentiality">Maintaining Confidentiality</h2>

<h3 id="principles-of-confidentiality">Principles of Confidentiality</h3>

<p>Schools often struggle with balancing a survivor’s confidentiality and fulfilling their obligation to provide a safe campus for everyone by holding perpetrators accountable.  But a few guiding principles should inform any reporting and confidentiality protocol: namely that confidentiality must give survivors choices and not shield a school from inaction.  To the greatest extent possible, the survivor’s wishes should be respected, whether it be for a full investigation – or not.</p>

<p>It’s also true that there’s no one-size-fits-all model of survivor care.  There must be options, which means that schools should make it clear up front who on campus must share what information with whom – and the circumstances in which a school may need to override a request for confidentiality and conduct an investigation to protect the greater campus community.</p>

<p>And in all cases, whether or not it fully investigates a particular incident, schools must respond. It must protect and help survivors reclaim their education, and determine what campus-wide, or more targeted, responses may be in order.</p>

<p>To help schools carry out these principles, we’ve come up with a sample reporting and confidentiality policy.  This is not meant as a policy to “cut and paste,” but rather one to help schools get started tackling this difficult issue.</p>

<h3 id="guide-to-drafting-a-sexual-assault-policy">Guide to Drafting a Sexual Assault Policy</h3>

<p>Every college and university should have an easily accessible, user-friendly sexual assault policy. As the Task Force recognizes, there is no one approach that suits every school – but as we also heard, schools have had difficulty constructing comprehensive policies.  To help schools develop or reevaluate their policies:</p>

<p>We are providing schools with a checklist for a sexual misconduct policy. This list provides both a suggested process for developing a policy, as well as the key elements a school should consider in drafting one.  At the threshold, and perhaps most importantly, schools should bring all the key stakeholders to the table – including students, survivors, concerned student groups including LGBT organizations, campus security, local law enforcement, resident advisors, on-campus advocates, and local victim service providers.  Effective policies will vary in scope and detail, but an inclusive process is common to all.</p>

<p>We have not endeavored with this checklist to provide schools with all the answers: again, depending on its size, mission, student body, location, administrative structure and experience, a school community is best situated to decide for itself what might work best. </p>

These partnerships can be formalized through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or other agreement between parties.

    <p>Many schools are working to address sexual assault on their campuses, but lack a way to understand the scope or nature of the problem. Climate surveys can help fill this gap in knowledge by finding out how students perceive and experience sexual assault on their campus. Conducting regular climate surveys is a best practice in dealing with campus sexual assault. Universities and colleges often have both the capacity and the will to conduct meaningful climate surveys, but are not sure where to start. This document provides climate survey items/questions that are among the best currently available. The first chapter provides an overview of <em>how</em> to conduct a climate survey, and the second chapter provides an example of an empirically informed survey. Campuses are encouraged to use both of these chapters to guide their work.</p>

    <p>Bystander intervention is a sexual assault prevention strategy that encourages witnesses to take safe action when they see a situation that might lead to sexual assault, and to support victims after an incident. Bystander intervention shows promise as a strategy to prevent sexual assault, particularly in college/university settings. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that bystander strategies may hold promise for the prevention of sexual assault, but more evaluation is needed. This document describes many different bystander programs used around the country and their common components. It also discusses how to deliver bystander education, and challenges to bystander action.</p>
